### TcrDataComparison

Contains a small collection of tools TCR data comparison. These tools can be used in combination with [IGoR](https://github.com/qmarcou/IGoR) as well as [ImmunoProbs](https://github.com/penuts7644/ImmunoProbs).

The `example_data` directory contains experimental and IGoR simulated data. The experimental mouse IG heavy chain data was obtained using sequencing. The simulated data contains two directories: `0_human_alpha_100seq` and `1_human_alpha_20000seq`. Both of these data directories contain 100 and 20000 CDR3 sequences respectively that were created (simulated) using the [IGoR](https://github.com/qmarcou/IGoR) package.

**Note:** in order to reduce storage, the data files inside `example_data/experimental` and `example_data/simulated` directories are compressed to zip archives.

Example data generated by the various script is stored in the `example_output` directory. Generated files that can be combined per row are located in `example_output/seq_data`.

**Note:** for some of the python scripts (located in the `python` directory) you'll need to have installed pygor module from IGoR. This module can be installed locally with pip by using command `pip install ./pygor` from within the [IGoR](https://github.com/qmarcou/IGoR) source directory. Requirements for the python scripts can be installed through the `requirements.txt` file.
