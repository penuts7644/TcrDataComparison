### TcrDataComparison

Contains a small collection of tools for TCR data comparison. These tools are used in combination with [ImmunoProbs](https://github.com/penuts7644/ImmunoProbs)'s docker image (which includes IGoR).

**Note:** for the `IgorOutputTranslator` python script (located in the `python` directory) you'll need to have installed pygor module from IGoR. This module can be installed locally with pip by using command `pip install ./pygor` from within the [IGoR](https://github.com/qmarcou/IGoR) source directory. Other requirements for the python scripts can be installed through the `requirements.txt` file.
