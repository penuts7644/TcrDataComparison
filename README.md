### TcrDataComparison
Master thesis (UiO) repo for TCR data comparison.

The `data` directory contains experimental and IGoR simulated
data. The experimental mouse Igm data was obtained using
sequencing. The simulated data contains two directories:
`0_human_alpha_100seq` and `1_human_alpha_20000seq`.
Both of these data directories contain 100 and 20000 CDR3
sequences respectively that were created (simulated) using
the [IGoR](https://github.com/qmarcou/IGoR) package.

IGoR models (from version 1.3.0) are stored in `models` and
are used to generate the CDR3 sequences.

Data generated by the various script is stored in the `output`
directory. Generated files that can be combined per row are
located in `output/seq_data`.

An additional bash script (`run_igor.sh`) is provided to
perform some of IGoR's main features with some very simple
commands. To show the help of the script run: `run_igor.sh -h`.

**Note:** in order to use the Python scripts in `python`, make
sure to have installed pygor module from IGoR. This module can
be installed locally with pip by using command
`pip install ./pygor` from within the IGoR source directory.
